The higher slopes are planted with Bourbon and the comparatively lower areas with the other cultivars: Caturra, Catuaí and Pache. Bourbon ripens early and planting it at the higher altitude with the correspondingly cooler temperatures slows its maturation down considerably. This means all the farm's coffee ripens at approximately the same time making it easier to harvest the crop.",
