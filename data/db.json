As the farm has been passed down through three generations it has been separated into three farms, Malacara A, B and C. José Guillermo Alvarez Prunera have had a difficult time dealing with a severe attack of Coffee Rust Disease which meant that an equally severe pruning regime was implemented, and they lost a good portion of their crop for a few years.

They have 95 hectares, 70 of which are planted with coffee and the remaining 25 are a forest reserve close to the Acatenango volcano. The altitude on the farm ranges from 1550m to 2100m. The higher slopes are planted with Bourbon and the comparatively lower areas with the other cultivars: Caturra, Catuaí and Pache. Bourbon ripens early and planting it at the higher altitude with the correspondingly cooler temperatures slows its maturation down considerably. This means all the farm's coffee ripens at approximately the same time making it easier to harvest the crop.",
